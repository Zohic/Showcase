# Showcase
3rd party resources:<br>
DirectX,<br>
GDIPlus - for loading images.<br>
both come with windows<br>
<br>
I was making DirectX 2d game engine and stuck on physics part.<br>
I really wanted to make it work, it was year ago already<br>
Mostly it's finished, but physics are too jittery and unstable<br>
<br>
just in case, <br>
there is little demo in the release folder, it requires font.png<br>
(press left and right mouse buttons for draging object)
